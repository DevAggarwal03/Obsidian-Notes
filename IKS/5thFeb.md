**Scientific Evidenece: Paleo-channels and Isotopic Studies**
- Satellite imagery and remote sensing revealed buried paleo-channels, confirming the ancient river course.
- Neodymium and Strontium isotopic analysis of sediments suggests a large Himalayan or Sub-Himalayan Saraswati-like river discharged into the Arabian Sea until about 8K BCE.
- These Scientific methods provided decisive evidence supporting textual descriptions.

**Dryin and Disappearance of the Saraswati**
- Hydrologica and satellite studies show:
    - Saraswaticeased to be a perennial river (flows throughout the year) round 3k BCE.
    - It dried up completely by around 1900 BCE.
- River desiccation likely began around 3500BCE.
- The main causes identified are:
    - Tectonic Activity
    - Shiftiing of tributaries, especially the Satluj (Satadru)
- Archaeological evidence shows cities like Kalibangan were abandoned due to the drying of the river.

**Archaeological correlation with civilization**
- Numerous Harappan sites are located along the Saraswati Paleo-channels
- These sites are more numerous and widespread than those along the Sindhu alone. (2 rivers main Saraswati (more settlement here) and Sindhu)
- The Archaeological record alligns with Vedic geography, chronology and settlement patterns.
- As a result, scholars increasingly use the term "Saraswati - Sindhu civilization" instead of only 
    "Sindhu Value Civilization"

**Significance of the discovery**
- The discovery of the Saraswati River is a landmark in Bharatiya historical studies.
- It provides a missing link between textual, archaeological and geological evidence.
- The rediscovery also offers a schentific  basis for dating Vedic Literature.
- Both archaiology and texts agree that the drying of Saraswati was a major geographical event in Bharatiya history

# **Saraswati - Sindhu Civilization**
- Archaiological sites along the Saraswati River are more numerous and widespread than those along the Sindhu alone.
- As a result, scholars increasingly prefer the term "Saraswati - sindhu civilization " rather than only "Sindhu valley civilization"
- This terminology better reflects the geographhical spread and cultural base of the civilization.

**Cultural and technological Advancement**
- the Saraswati and Sindhu river system supported a technologically advanced civilization.
    - Achievements included:
        - Advanced mathematics
        - Sophisticated town planning and architecture
        - Efficient drainage systems
        - knowledge of hygiene, food preservation and storage
        - Expertise in metal tools and crafts
- Scholars consider Bharatiya civilization more progressive than many contemporary civilizations, including Egypt and Babylonia.

**Decline of Urban Centres and Migrations**
- Investigations show that urban cultures declined after 1900 BCE.
- main factors included:
    - Tectonic Movements
    - Floods
    - Shifting of riverbeds
    - Drying up of rivers (notably Saraswati)
    - As a result, people gradually migrated to other regions for survival.
