# UNIT3:
### Introduction
- Based on science, mathematical aspects of IKS
- Motion
- Matter

#### Concept of Atom and Laws of Motion
- Ancient Bharatiya thinkers believed reality can be understood through many complementary perspectives.
- To understand matter, universe and life, several schools of tought developed in Bharata around 600-300BCE
- These traditions tried to explain natural phenomena and physical reality.

#### Early scientific Ideas:
- Early scholars attempted to observe and record properties of natural substance.
- Observations about nature were summarized and classified.
- Their works contained:
	- Intuitive ideas
	- Early theories of matter
	- Explanations of the universe
- These represent early stages of scientific Investigation.

#### Importance of These early works
- Though primitive, these ideas were important in the development of knoledge
- They show early attempts to understand:
	- Structure of matter
	- Natural Laws
	- Behaviour of the physical world
- Such efforts contributed to the growth of science over time.

#### Atomic Ideas in Indian Philosophy
- Atomic concepts appeared in several traditions:
	- Vaisesika
	- Samkhya
	- Jain Philosophical traditionson
- Some ideas of Vaisesika are surprisingly similar to modern scientific thinking.


#### Ideas from Ancient Texts:
1. Imp discussions about matter also appear in:
	- Upanishads
	- Brahmanas
2. These Texts suggested that:
	- matter is made of very small particles
	- These particles combine through interactions.
	- Aggregation of particles forms visible matter.

#### Concept of matter and motion
- Ancient theories also discussed:
	- Nature of particles
	- Light
	- space
	- Time
	- Motion of particles and objects
- These Ideas attempted to explain how the universe functions.

#### Conclusion
- Ancient Bharatiya philosophers made early attempts to explain matter and motion.
- Their theories combined observation, reasoning, and philosophy.
- These contributions form an important part of the historical development of science.

## Vaisesika and the Concept of Atoom
1. The Vaisesika system is an imp concept of the IKS and presents an early explanation of the structure of matter
2. The philosopher Maharishi Kanada, around 600 BCE or earlier, proposed that all material substances are composed of extremely small particles called Anu.
3. According to this view. Anu is the ultimate indivisble unit of matter and represents the most fundamental consitutent of the physical world.
4. In mordern interpretation, the term Anu can be compared to the concept of atom, while the combination of atoms gives rise to molecules and larger structures.
5. The Vaisesika system therefore attempts to explain how matter originates, how it is structured, and how diff substances are formed through combinations of these fundamental particles.

### Nature and Characteristics of Anu
- In Vaisesika philosophy, the Anu is described as ann extremely subtle entity that forms the basis of all materials objects.
- It is considered an energy point with no measurable mass and no dimensions, indicating its extremely subtle and fundamental nature.
- Since it is beyond direct perception, the existence of the atom is inferred through logical reasoning and observation of material objects.

### Imp Characteristics of Anu include:
- It is invisible and cannot be detected directly by the senses.
- It is the smallest possible particle of matter.
- It is indivisible, meaning matter cannot be reduced beyond this level
- It is eternal and indestructible, implying that atoms themselves are never destroyed, only rearranged.
- It is spherical and imperceptible, and its existence must be concluded through inference.
Thus The theory proposes that all physical substances organic from combinations of these fundamental atomic units.

#### Arrangement of atom and logical Reasoning
A central idea in Kanada's theory is the arrangement of atoms in space.
- Matter does not arise from atoms individually but from specific combinations and spatial arrangements of these atoms.
- The nature and properties of substances depend on:
	1. The number of atoms present
	2. Their arrangement
	3. Their interactions.

#### Kanada also provided a logical argument against the idea that matter can be divided endlessly.
- If matter were infinitely divisible, then objects of very different sizes would ultimately becomes the same.
- For example, a mountain and a mustard seed would have equal size, Since both could be divided endlessly.
- Since this is clearly not true, there must be a smallest unit beyond which division cannot continue.
ThereFore:
- Matter must consist of finite fundamental particles - atoms (Anu)
- A mountain is larger simply because it contains a much greater number of atoms than a mustard seed.
This reasoning represents an early philosophical justification for the existence of atoms.

### Elements and Formation of Molecules
In the vaisesika framework, the material world is associated with five fundamental elements (bhatas)
- Earth
- Water
- Fire
- Air
- Ether

Important points from the theory:
- The first four elements are finite and perceptible and are composed of atoms with diff properties.
- Ether, however, is considered infinite and continuous in nature, and therefore does not consist of atoms.

	Atoms combine to form larger structures through natural interactions.
	Imp forms of combination include:
	- Dvyanuka - a structure formed by the combination of two atoms.
	- Tryanuka (or Trasarenu) - a structure formed by the combination of three atoms.
	Form These simple combinations, large molecular structures and visible matter are produced.

#### Different substances arise because atoms:
- Belong to diff classes
- Combine in different numbers
- Arrange themselves in different spatial patterns.
The idea explains the diversity of materials in the physical world.
#### Chemical Combination and limitations
The vaisesika system also dicusses processes similar to chemical reactions.
- atoms posses an inherent tendency to combine with one anoter.
- When atoms interact, they form molecules and compunds.
- Existing molecules may also break apart and recombine. leading to new substances.
- These processes may occur under the influence of various condiitions such as teperature and other physical factors.
Substances can therefore be classified as:
- Mono-bhautik
- Hetero-bhautik

**However, kanada also recognized certain conceptual difficulties in the theory:**
1. If an atom truly has no size, it becomes diff to explain how a collection of such particles could produce a material object with measurable size. This is similar to trying to obtain the number one by adding zeros.
2. On the other hand, if an atom has finite size, it should logically be divisible into smaller parts, which contradicts the idea that the atom is indivisible. 
These philosophical questions reveeal the depth of early atomic theory and continue to resonate with discussion in the philosophy of modern science.
